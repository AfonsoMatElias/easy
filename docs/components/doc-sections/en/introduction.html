    <h3> <a id="what" href="#what"> What is Easy.js? </a> </h3>
    <p>
        Easy.js, short for <span style="color:var(--easy-yellow)">Easy</span>
        and <span style="color:var(--easy-black)">Asyncronous Javascript</span>,
        is a javascript library for building user interfaces and helps in the
        web applications development, providing a synchronous interaction
        between user interfaces and Javascript data.
    </p>

    <h3> <a id="why" href="#why"> So, Why Easy.js? </a> </h3>
    <p>
        As the name says, it is a javascript library really easy to use that provides
        to you a simple way to interact with your HTML by using Reactive Properties,
        Scoping data in the HTML, reusable components written in pure HTML,
        api calls using only attributes, and so on... It's very good and simple to
        build Single Page Application. No Virtual DOM is used, it uses the Real
        DOM to handle all the data changes.
    </p>

    <h3> <a id="compatibility" href="#compatibility"> Browsers Compatibility </a> </h3>
    <p>
        It was tested in almost every popular browsers and IE 11, below that is not suported,
        because it uses some comcepts of <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6"
            class="mark-el">
            ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) </a>.
    </p>
