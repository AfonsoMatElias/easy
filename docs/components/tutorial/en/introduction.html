            <h3> What is Easy.js? </h3>

            <p>
                Easy.js, short for <span style="color:var(--easy-yellow)">Easy</span>
                and <span style="color:var(--easy-black)">Asyncronous Javascript</span>,
                is a javascript library for building user interfaces, and helps in the
                web applications development, providing a synchronous interaction
                between user interfaces and Javascript data.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is a very easy library to get the hang of, with a simple command so you can
                see the results on the screen, it is totally focused on front-end development,
                it can be used to create the entire application as in specific parts of it.
                It is also good at building Single Page Applications, as it has the concept
                of web components.
            </p>

            <h3> No Virtual DOM? ðŸ¤” </h3>

            <p>
                Easy does not use the Virtual DOM concept to update data in the UI, for this
                reason it associates each property of the current instance with the fields
                where it was requested in the UI, and whenever a change occurs in property,
                it updates all the fields associated with it.
            </p>

            <h3> About the Tutorial </h3>

            <p>

                of the tab we need to <i class="note mark-el">editor.tab(tabName)</i> the <i class="mark-el">tabName</i>
                may not contain <i class="mark-el">spaces</i> and <i class="mark-el">special characters</i>, use hifen
