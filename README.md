## Introduction

Easy.js, short for <span style="color:#F0DB4F">Easy</span> 
and <span style="color:#494a47" >Asyncronous Javascript</span>, 
is a javascript library for building user interfaces and that helps in the 
development of web applications, providing a synchronous interaction 
between user interfaces and Javascript data.

### So, Why Easy.js?
As the name says, it is a javascript library really easy to use that provides to you a simple way to interact 
with your HTML by using Reactive Properties, Scoping data in the HTML, reusable components written in pure HTML, 
api calls using only attributes, and so on... It's very good and simple to build Single Page Application.
**No Virtual DOM is used**, it uses the **Real DOM** to handle all the data changes.

### Browsers Compatibility
It was tested in almost every popular browsers and IE 11, below that is not suported.

### Scale of Projects
A web application fully developed with easy.js was tested only with small projects, larger projects was not tested yet.
