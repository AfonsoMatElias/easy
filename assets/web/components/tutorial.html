                <h3> What is Easy.js? </h3>

                <p>
                    Easy.js, short for <span style="color:var(--easy-yellow)">Easy</span>
                    and <span style="color:var(--easy-black)">Asyncronous Javascript</span>,
                    is a javascript library for building user interfaces and that helps in the
                    development of web applications, providing a synchronous interaction
                    between user interfaces and Javascript data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is a very easy library to get the hang of, with a simple command so you can
                    see the results on the screen, it is totally focused on front-end development,
                    it can be used to create the entire application as in specific parts of it.
                    It is also good at building Single Page Applications, as it has the concept
                    of web components.
                </p>

                <h3> No Virtual DOM? ðŸ¤” </h3>

                <p>
                    Easy does not use the Virtual DOM concept to update data in the UI, for this
                    reason it associates each property of the current instance with the fields
                    where it was requested in the UI, and whenever an update of the property in
                    question occurs, it updates all the fields associated with it the property.
                </p>
